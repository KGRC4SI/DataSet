Clean sofa
Walk into the living room and look around the sofa and see the pillows. Find and grab a towel to eliminate any gathered dust from the pillow. Walk to the sofa and grab each of the pillows. Then, wipe down the pillow with that towel to clean the dust off the surfaces and shake them before putting them back on the sofa.
